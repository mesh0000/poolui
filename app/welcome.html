		<h3>&#9656;&nbsp;Hardfork went smoothly!</h3>
			<p>On Monday 17.04 I will start reevaluating the TX fee settings. I think we will go with low prio TXs, so I can set the fee deduction as low as possible.</p>
		<h3>&#9656;&nbsp;Double Payout issue</h3>
			<p>There's been an issue with double payouts to miners in the past few days. I'm working on resolving the issue. In the meantime, I had to deduct the double payout amounts from the affected miner balances. Please understand that I only reduced the balance when you accidentially got a double payout (Check your wallet. Payout stats on pool page don't show them in all cases). So effectively, you got paid in advance. Please have the decency and keep mining until your balance reached 0. <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i></p><p>Here you can check if you are affected: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/QVtPdKK.png" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/QVtPdKK.png</a></p><p>Sorry for the Inconvenience</p>
